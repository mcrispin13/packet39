# Project Title

Cranes are heavy, dangerous and expensive equipment. Crane accidents are often the direct result of negligence of the crane-related professionals or the lack of adequate operator training or experience.Adequate training is a must. A crane simulator is a cost-efficient solution for offering training and refresh training to crane operators in a safe and sound environment with no risk of damage or injuries.

## Getting Started

Upon loading up the simulation in VR the user is placed in front of the operational controls, the user is able to interact with the scene by using the grabbing trigger on the VR controller.

1. To initiate the step by step simulation grab the ignition button (red button) and push in slowly until it turns green and is activated.
2. The user is now able to interact with all the levers on the operation controls dashboard. Move the left most lever by grabbing and pulling FORWARD and BACK to rotate the crane.
3. Grab the second lever from the left, to rotate the boom of the crane UP and DOWN.
4. Grab the third lever from the left, to extend the pulley of the crane UP and DOWN.
5. Finally grab the last lever on the right to extend the sub boom from the crane FORWARD and BACK.
6. To enable the magnet on the crane grab and push the button on top of the dashboard (orange button) down to activate magnet ON/OFF.
7. Position the magnet above the crane close enough until it attaches to the barrel (in front of the user).
8. Lift and position the crane with the barrel attached over the designated platform and turn of the magnet button.
9. Lastly, to detach barrel from magnet slight move the second lever up or down.

At this point the barrel should fall on top of the platform and the user has completed each step on the guideline (found to the right of the operator) and finished the simulation.



## Deployment
